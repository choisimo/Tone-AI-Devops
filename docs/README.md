## üéØ Project Overview

**Current Stack:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
- UI Library: shadcn/ui components
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime + Storage + Auth)
- Deployment: Vite build process

**Key Features:**
- Deployment monitoring with logs and results
- Magic Canvas for collaborative design
- Comprehensive UI component library
- Real-time updates and notifications

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Principles

### Loose Coupling
- Services communicate only through well-defined interfaces
- No direct database sharing between services
- Event-driven architecture for cross-service communication

### Contract-First Development
- OpenAPI/TypeScript contracts define all interfaces
- Mock adapters enable parallel development
- Versioned APIs ensure backward compatibility

### Security by Design
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Row-level security (RLS) in Supabase
- Signed URLs for secure file access

### Observability
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Performance metrics and monitoring
